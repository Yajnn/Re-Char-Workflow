# Rechar Workflow
Rechar Workflow (a.k.a Re-character Workflow) is a tooling Blender addon used to speed up my workflows when building and developing 3D character models from my previous works or other works.

## Features
Current features include:
- Shape Key Transfer: transfers the shape keys of one object to another by nearest vertex.
- more to come...

## Versions
| Version    | Date         | Description                           |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0.0.1      | 2024/11/03   | initial ver., shape key transfer      |

## Roadmap
This is a list of things I'd want in the future, no promises:
- Shape key transfer by shape key selection?
- Armature duplication from one object to another empty object
    - Dupe an armature to a mesh object
- Weight transfers from one object to another by nearest vertex
    - This can be done manually, but can we automate it?
- Find ways to deal with the VRM and MMD/PMX armature and shape keys for cross-tool usage
- Language translation of bones, shape keys, etc.?
    - Working with VRM and MMD/PMX means working with Eng and Jp, can we handle/deal with both?
- more...

## TODO
- Cleanup
- Look into roadmap for future features
